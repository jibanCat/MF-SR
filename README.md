# multi-fidelity symbolic regression

A repo to start the Symbolic regression for multi-fidelity project.

Symbolic regression relies on MilesCranmer PySR.

Suggestion for low-fidelity fitting using model_selection = "best",
high-fidelity fitting using model_selection = "score" (avoiding relying too much on minimizing the loss).

## Example taken from Emukit website (Forrester function)

This is the most difficult example, but also shows the limitation of SR on this type of problem.
